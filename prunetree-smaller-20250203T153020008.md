## Introduction

The objective of pruning is to produce strong, healthy, attractive plants. By understanding how, when and why to prune, and by following a few simple principles, this objective can be achieved.

## Why Prune

The main reasons for pruning ornamental and shade trees include safety, health, and aesthetics. In addition, pruning can be used to stimulate fruit production and increase the value of timber. Pruning for safety (Fig. 1A) involves removing branches that could fall and cause injury or property damage, trimming branches that  interfere with lines of sight on streets or driveways, and removing branches that grow into utility lines. Safety pruning can be largely avoided by carefully choosing species that will not grow beyond the space available to them, and have strength and form characteristics that are suited to the site.

Pruning for health (Fig. 1B) involves removing diseased or insect-infested wood, thinning the crown to increase airflow and reduce some pest problems, and removing

crossing and rubbing branches. Pruning can best be used to encourage trees to develop a strong structure and reduce the likelihood of damage during severe weather. Removing broken or damaged limbs  encourage wound closure.

Pruning for aesthetics (Fig. 1C) involves enhancing the natural form and character of trees or stimulating flower production.  Pruning for form can be especially important on opengrown trees that do very little self-pruning.

All woody plants shed branches in response to shading and competition.  Branches that do not produce enough carbohydrates from photosynthesis to sustain themselves die and are eventually shed; the resulting wounds are sealed by woundwood (callus). Branches that are poorly attached may be broken off by wind and accumulation of snow and ice. Branches removed by such natural forces often result in large, ragged wounds that rarely seal. Pruning as a cultural practice can be used to supplement or replace these natural processes and increase the strength and longevity of plants.

Trees have many forms, but the most common types are pyramidal (excurrent) or spherical ( decurrent) .  Trees with pyramidal crowns, e.g., most conifers, have a strong central stem and lateral branches that are more or less horizontal and do not compete with the central stem for dominance.  Trees with spherical crowns, e.g., most hardwoods, have many lateral branches that may compete for dominance.

To reduce the need for pruning it is best to consider a tree's natural form. It is very difficult

to impose an unnatural form on a tree without a commitment to constant maintenance.

Pollarding and topiary are extreme examples of pruning to create a desired, unnatural effect. Pollarding is the practice of pruning trees annually to remove all new growth.  The following year, a profusion of new branches is produced at the ends of the branches.  Topiary involves pruning trees and shrubs into geometric or animal shapes.  Both pollarding and topiary are specialized applications that involve pruning to change the natural form of trees.  As topiary demonstrates, given enough care and attention plants can be pruned into nearly any form.  Yet just as proper pruning can enhance the form or character of plants, improper pruning can destroy it.

## Pruning Approaches

Producing strong structure should be the emphasis when pruning young trees.  As trees mature, the aim of pruning will shift to maintaining tree structure, form, health and appearance.

Proper pruning cuts are made at a node, the point at which one branch or twig attaches to another.  In the spring of the year growth begins at buds, and twigs grow until a new node is formed.  The length of a branch between nodes is called an internode.

The most common types of pruning are:

## 1. Crown Thinning (Fig. 2)

Crown thinning , primarily for hardwoods, is the selective removal of branches to increase light penetration and air movement throughout the crown of a tree.  The intent is to maintain or develop a tree's structure and form.  To avoid unnecessary stress and prevent excessive production of epicormic sprouts, no more than one-quarter of the living crown should be removed at a time. If it is necessary to remove more, it should be done over successive years.

Branches with strong U-shaped angles of attachment should be retained (Fig 3A). Branches with narrow, V-shaped angles of attachment often form included bark and should be removed (Fig. 3B). Included bark forms when two branches grow at sharply acute angles to one another, producing a wedge of inward-rolled bark between them. Included bark prevents strong attachment of branches, often causing a crack at the point below where the branches meet. Codominant stems that are approximately the same size and arise from the same position often form included bark.  Removing some of the lateral branches from a codominant stem can reduce its growth enough to allow the other stem to become dominant.

Lateral branches should be no more than onehalf to three-quarters of the diameter of the stem at the point of attachment.  Avoid producing "lion's tails," tufts of branches and foliage at the ends of branches, caused by removing all inner lateral branches and foliage. Lion's tails can result in sunscalding, abundant epicormic sprouts , and weak branch structure and breakage.  Branches that rub or cross
